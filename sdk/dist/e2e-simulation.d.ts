 *
 * Demonstrates a complete poker hand flow:
 * 1. Setup: Create deck, generate player keys
 * 2. Shuffle: Each player shuffles and masks the deck
 * 3. Deal: Deal hole cards to players
 * 4. Unmask: Players unmask their own cards
 * 5. Betting: Players take actions (bet, call, fold, raise)
 * 6. Generate Prover.toml files for each circuit
